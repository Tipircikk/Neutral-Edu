# **App Name**: AI Model Switcher

## Core Features:

- Model Listing: List available AI models, with name and description
- Model Selection: Allow the user to choose a model to use for all AI functionality.
- Error Management: Issue warnings, and report errors and error codes to the user

## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: Dark gray (#212121) to provide a professional and modern feel, reminiscent of developer tools.
- Primary color: Electric blue (#7DF9FF) for interactive elements, indicating the app's tech focus. The hue relates to data, code, screens, and 'the matrix'.
- Accent color: Soft orange (#FFA500) for warnings, drawing the user's attention.  It's different in both brightness and saturation to ensure visibility against the primary color.
- Clear, monospaced font for displaying configurations, errors and code-like content.
- Split-screen layout to compare configurations, with models on the left and the relevant documentation/settings on the right.
- Subtle transitions when switching between AI models.
